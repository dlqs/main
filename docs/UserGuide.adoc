== Introduction

*Know-It-All* is a solution for those who find carrying physical flashcards around troublesome and prefer an application to help them store and organize their learning material. *Know-It-All*â€™s easy to use interface and digital storage allow users to effectively utilize intermittent breaks between lessons to cramp in that last bit of knowledge. *Know-It-All* is targeted at medicine students in NUS as their studies requires a considerable amount of memory work, and deals with content that is suitable for the bite-sized flashcard format.
